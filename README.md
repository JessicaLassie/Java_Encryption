# Java_Encryption

Encryptor is a desktop application in Java/Swing allowing to encrypt/decrypt a file in AES or RSA.
The application is divided into two layers: a view layer and a controller layer.
The view is responsible for the interface and is developed in Swing. The controller is in charge of performing actions on the data entered by the user and is developed in Java.
